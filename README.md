### Work Experience
Decision Score Model, Manager
- Designed and implemented strategic models based on scoring models to optimize the retail portfolio profitability, aligning risk management practices with business objectives
- Monitored loan portfolio performance through KPIs (PSI, KS, LA) to identify shifts in the borrower's proactively behavior and assess model effectiveness in detecting high-risk applicant profiles
- Analyzed extensive databases to develop risk mitigation strategies for unexpected events (e.g., Otis Huracan), enhancing portfolio resilience
- Prepared reports on consumer credit analysis to support informed financial planning and strategic decision-making in cooperation with the project manager
- Conducted data extraction and analysis to identify key variables for score model development, ensuring optimal predictive accuracy and model performance


### Projects 
**Consumer Credit Risk**
- The primary objective of this report is to develop a comprehensive and Basel III-compliant framework for assessing consumer credit risk in the context of the U.S. mortgage market. The potential losses are quantified through three key risk parameters: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). By combining these components, the report ultimately calculates the provisions that financial institutions should set aside to cover expected credit losses, in accordance with regulatory best practices.

**Bond Pricing**
- This document aims to assess the economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada that influence the fixed-income market, with a particular focus on how these factors affect the performance and valuation of our portfolio.

**Canadian Household Segmentation and Spending Behaviour**
- This project investigates patterns in Canadian household demographics and spending using machine learning techniques with data from Environics Analytics (Environics Analytics, 2024) . The goal is to identify unique household segments and understand what drives their financial decisions.

**Estimating lookback options price: Monte Carlo Simulation, Binomial Lattice & Black Scholes**
- Lookback options are path-dependent options whose payoff depends on the minimum or maximum value of the underlying asset during the derivative’s lifetime. Numerous ways exist to estimate the price of this exotic option. This paper will present three methods: Monte Carlo Simulation, Binomial Lattice, and Black-Scholes.

**Churn Model Applied to Credit Card Customers**
![CC](/assets/credit_card.jpeg)
- The objective of this project is to find one or multiple models, both supervised and unsupervised, that allow us to predict the number of good customers (those who continue with the service) and bad customers (those who abandon the service) within the portfolio, to control the credit risk according to the risk level determined by the Portfolio Manager.

**Investment Portfolio**
![Finance](/assets/finance.jpeg)
-  This project aims to present a portfolio under the modern portfolio theory, consisting of 3 risky assets (GRUMAB, LABB, and GCC) and a risk-free asset (BI CETES 210520). Subsequently, a comparison of the portfolio's risk level with the market portfolio risk is conducted. Finally, an investment strategy is analyzed.
