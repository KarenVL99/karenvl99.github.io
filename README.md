**Investment Portfolio**
![Finance](/assets/finance.jpeg)
-  This project aims to present a portfolio under the modern portfolio theory, consisting of 3 risky assets (GRUMAB, LABB, and GCC) and a risk-free asset (BI CETES 210520). Subsequently, a comparison of the portfolio's risk level with the market portfolio risk is conducted. Finally, an investment strategy is analyzed.
